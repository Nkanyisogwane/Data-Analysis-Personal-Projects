## üß± Data Modeling Approach

A **Star Schema** approach was applied in Power BI, splitting the original transactional data into **Fact** and **Dimension** tables to enhance performance and support flexible analytics.

### üßæ Fact Table: `FactSales`
Contains raw transaction-level data with relevant foreign keys:
- `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, `Country`

**Calculated Column:**
- `TotalPrice` = `Quantity` √ó `UnitPrice`

### üßç Dimension Tables:
- **DimCustomer**: `CustomerID` (unique customer identifiers)
- **DimProduct**: `StockCode`, `Description` (product details)
- **DimCountry**: `Country` (geographical data)
- **DimDate**: DAX-generated date table with hierarchy (Year, Month, Quarter, Day)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Architecture & Methodology

The project followed a structured, iterative approach to address real-world data challenges through each stage of the pipeline.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Acquisition & Initial Transformation (Python)

- **Source**: Raw transactional data in `.xlsx` format (downloaded from Kaggle)
- **Initial Issues Identified**:
  - Missing `CustomerID` values
  - Negative `Quantity` and `UnitPrice` values (indicating returns or errors)
  - Inconsistent `StockCode` formats (e.g., 'POST', alphanumeric noise)
  - Excel serial-based `InvoiceDate` requiring parsing

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: Power BI Excel Ingestion Errors

Power BI failed to connect directly to the Excel file via OLEDB due to:
- 32-bit/64-bit driver conflicts
- General connection instability

#### ‚úÖ Solution: Python Script for Data Preprocessing

A Python script was developed to:
- Filter out rows with:
  - Missing `CustomerID`
  - Negative `Quantity` or non-positive `UnitPrice`
- Standardize `StockCode` by:
  - Removing non-product entries (e.g., 'POST')
  - Ensuring consistent formatting
- Parse `InvoiceDate` from Excel serial to proper `datetime` format
- Fix data types (e.g., `CustomerID` as `int`, `UnitPrice` and `Quantity` as `float/int`)

**‚û°Ô∏è Output**: Cleaned and normalized `.csv` files for star schema modeling:
- `dim_country.csv`
- `dim_customer.csv`
- `dim_date.csv`
- `dim_product.csv`
- `fact_sales.csv`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling (Power BI Star Schema)

Imported the cleaned `.csv` files into Power BI Desktop to build an analytical data model.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: Duplicates & Referential Integrity

Initial modeling issues included:
- Ensuring **unique keys** in dimension tables (e.g., `DimCustomer`, `DimProduct`)
- Maintaining **referential integrity** between fact and dimension tables

#### ‚úÖ Solution: Power Query Cleanup

- Applied granular transformations in **Power Query**:
  - Removed duplicate rows in dimension tables
  - Verified consistency of foreign keys across tables

- Established **one-to-many relationships** from:
  - `FactSales` ‚û°Ô∏è `DimProduct`
  - `FactSales` ‚û°Ô∏è `DimCustomer`
  - `FactSales` ‚û°Ô∏è `DimDate`
  - `FactSales` ‚û°Ô∏è `DimCountry`

**üß± Result**: A clean, performant **Star Schema model** enabling accurate analytics.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Calculation

Developed core business KPIs using DAX in Power BI:

- **Total Sales**  
- **Total Quantity Sold**  
- **Total Invoices**  
- **Average Order Value**  
- **Unique Customers**

These KPIs served as foundational insights for the dashboard.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis & Advanced Analytics (Python)

Performed comprehensive data exploration and statistical analysis using Python.

#### üìà Sales Trend Analysis
- Utilized `.describe()` for statistical summary
- Analyzed **daily and monthly sales trends**
- Incorporated **30-day rolling averages** to smooth volatility

üñºÔ∏è *Python Plot: Daily Sales Trend*

**üîç Insight**: 
Despite fluctuations, sales showed an **upward trend** toward year-end, indicating **seasonal patterns** ‚Äî particularly relevant for inventory planning and campaign timing.

---

#### üë• Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

Executed **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** analysis:
- Used `scikit-learn`‚Äôs **K-Means clustering**
- Segmented customers into 4 groups:
  - *Champions*
  - *Loyal*
  - *At-Risk*
  - *Lapsed*

üñºÔ∏è *Python Plot: Customer Segments by Frequency vs. Monetary Value*

**üîç Insight**:
Clear segmentation showed small but high-value customers were well-separated from the lower-value, infrequent purchasers ‚Äî critical for targeted marketing.

---

#### üèÜ Product Performance Analysis

- Identified **Top 10 products** by total revenue
- Analyzed **StockCode frequency** to detect product popularity

üñºÔ∏è *Python Plot: Top 10 Products by Revenue*

**üîç Insight**:
A small group of products (e.g., *PAPER CRAFT , LITTLE BIRDIE*) accounted for a **disproportionate share of revenue** ‚Äî a signal for strategic stock and promotional focus.

---

#### üîÑ Power BI Integration

Exported `CustomerID` with assigned RFM segment to `customer_segments.csv` for seamless use in Power BI dashboard filters and visualizations.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Server Integration & Analytical Queries

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: SQL Server Import Roadblocks & Driver Compatibility  
Initial efforts to export Power BI-prepared tables (via DAX Studio to Excel) and import into SQL Server were blocked by frustrating **64-bit driver compatibility issues**.

### üí° Solution: Python as Data Integration Layer  
- Enhanced the Python script to connect directly to SQL Server using **pyodbc** and **SQLAlchemy**.  
- Programmatically loaded cleaned dimension and fact tables (.csv files) into SQL Server with `to_sql()` method.  
- Ensured **seamless and reliable database population** process, bypassing previous driver issues.

---

### üîç SQL Query Development  
Executed analytical queries directly on SQL Server to extract key business insights:

- **Customer Type Analysis:**  
  Classified customers as **'Repeat'** or **'One-time'** based on count of distinct invoices ‚Äî showcasing aggregation and customer behavior categorization.

- **Inactive Customer Identification (Churn Candidates):**  
  Identified customers with **no purchases for over 6 months** relative to the latest sales date, enabling early **churn prediction** and retention strategies.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Dashboard Development (Power BI)

### üé® Dashboard Design  
- Created a **visually appealing and intuitive Power BI dashboard** showcasing Global Sales Performance.  
- Included key visuals: overall KPIs, sales trends, top products, and top customers.

---

### üõ† Visual Troubleshooting & Refinement  
- Fixed a **Top 5 Customers by Total Sales** bar chart issue where gaps appeared and CustomerID was treated as a continuous numeric axis, causing confusing visuals.  
- Solution: Changed **CustomerID data type to Text** in Power BI data model.  
- Adjusted Y-axis formatting to **disable "Show items with no data"**, ensuring only relevant customers displayed.

---

### ‚ö° Enhanced Interactivity  
- Added essential slicers for dynamic dashboard filtering:  
  - **Month/Year Slicer** for time-based analysis  
  - **Country Slicer** for geographic insights  
  - **Customer Segment Slicer** integrating Python-derived RFM clusters, enabling targeted insights by segment  
- Carefully modeled relationships between **customer_segments.csv** and **DimCustomer** table to support filtering.  
- Implemented a **"Reset Slicers" button** via Power BI Bookmarks for improved user experience.
