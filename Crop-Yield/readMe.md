# Crop Yield Dashboard

This repository contains the **Crop Yield Dashboard** created as part of my ongoing **December Challenge** for personal projects. The dashboard was built using **Power BI** and provides insights into agricultural data, focusing on **crop yields**, **rainfall**, **fertilizer usage**, and **regional comparisons**.

## Project Overview

The **Crop Yield Dashboard** helps visualize key agricultural metrics, providing actionable insights into crop performance, environmental factors, and resource allocation. It includes various interactive elements to explore the data, such as KPI cards, bar charts, and map visualizations.

### Key Features:
- **KPI Cards**: Track important metrics such as **Total Yield**, **Total Rainfall**, **Average Yield with Fertilizer**, etc.
- **Max Yield Comparison**: A breakdown of **maximum yield** per crop type.
- **Map Visualizations**: Show **rainfall distribution** and **crop yields** across different regions.
- **Fertilizer Usage Breakdown**: Analyze the proportion of fertilizer used in different regions.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Power BI**: Used for creating the dashboard and visualizing the data.
- **DAX**: Used for data analysis and calculations.
- **Agricultural Dataset**: The dataset used contains information on crops, rainfall, fertilizer usage, and regions.

## Folder Structure

The folder contains the following key components:
- **Crop_Yield_Dashboard.pbix**: The main **Power BI file** used to create the dashboard.
- **Images**: Screenshots of the final dashboard for visualization.
