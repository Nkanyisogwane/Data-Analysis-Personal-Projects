# **Data Analysis Personal Projects**

This repository showcases my personal data analysis projects as an aspiring **junior data analyst**. Here, you’ll find projects where I apply everything I've learned from guided projects, including some that use **SQL and Power BI** and others focused on **Power BI only**. These projects reflect my journey in building practical skills in data analysis, from data cleaning to creating insightful visualizations.
