Bank Marketing Analysis: Power BI Dashboard & SQL Queries
Project Overview
For this project, I worked with a bank marketing dataset from Kaggle, focusing on two main aspects:

Power BI Dashboard – A Deposit Performance Overview dashboard to visualize key insights.
SQL Queries – A set of structured queries to analyze patterns and trends in the dataset.
Power BI Dashboard: Deposit Performance Overview
I first built a Power BI dashboard to get a high-level view of deposit trends, customer demographics, and other key metrics. The goal was to provide clear, actionable insights through visualizations that help in understanding customer behavior and marketing performance.

SQL Queries: Fast-Paced Problem Solving with AI
Once the dashboard was done, I shifted to SQL analysis, but this time, I wasn’t focused on learning – I already had a solid understanding of the data. Instead, I approached it as if I had a deadline in a real work scenario. My focus was:

Using AI (ChatGPT) to fast-track query generation
Ensuring accuracy & efficiency rather than spending time on manual query building
Extracting key insights quickly instead of diving deep into theoretical learning
The queries explore:
✔️ Customer demographics (job, marital status, etc.)
✔️ Deposit conversion rates
✔️ Impact of previous campaigns
✔️ Monthly trends in deposits
✔️ Correlation between balance and deposit behavior

This project highlights how AI can be leveraged for rapid problem-solving in data analysis, ensuring that results are delivered fast without compromising accuracy.

Feel free to check out the queries, explore the dashboard, and see how AI-assisted data analysis can improve efficiency. 🚀
